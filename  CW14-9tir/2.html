      The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is vulnerable to deliberate
      spoofing signal attacks. Once the user wrongly locks on the spoofing
      signal, the wrong position, velocity, and time (PVT) information will be
      calculated, which will harm the user
    </p>
    <p class="p2">
      GNSS spoofing signals are difficult to carry out spoofing attacks in the
      direction of arrival (DOA) of the real signal, so the spoofing detection
      method based on DOA is very effective. On the basis of identifying
      spoofing signals, accurate DOA information of the signal can be further
      used to locate the spoofer. At present, the existing DOA monitoring
      methods for spoofing signals are mainly based on dedicated antenna arrays
      and receivers, which are costly and difficult to upgrade and are not
      conducive to large-scale deployment, upgrade, and maintenance

      This paper proposes a spoofing detection and direction-finding method
      based on a low-cost commercial GNSS board component (including an
      antenna). Based on the traditional principle of using a multi-antenna
      carrier phase to solve DOA, this paper innovatively solves the following
      problems: the poor direction-finding accuracy caused by the unstable phase
      center of low-cost commercial antennas, the low success rate of spoofing
      detection in a multipath environment,

      prototype equipment for spoofing detection and direction-finding is
      developed. The measured results show that it can effectively detect
      spoofing signals in open environments. Under a certain false alarm rate,
      the detection success rate can reach 100%, and the typical
      direction-finding accuracy can reach 5.
